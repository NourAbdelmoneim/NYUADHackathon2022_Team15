SALEM TESSLAM

Salem Tesslam solves issues of congestion, environmental solution, and , importantly, relieves the pressure of time constraint for delivery drivers looking to make multiple stops that can lead to severe vehicle accidents.  We implement Quantum Computing as a means of getting the fastest, most efficient routes in ways that classical computers couldn't complete within a reasonable amount of time to come up with a solution to the famous, NP-hard, travelling salesman problem.  The user can enter multiple points where they must reach for a dropoff of goods, and our algorithm takes into account all the factors necessary to make their ride quicker, thus discouraging them from weaving in and out of traffic just to get a job done quicker and make more money.  This app will prove to be a fantastic use of a new, innovative technology for social good.
